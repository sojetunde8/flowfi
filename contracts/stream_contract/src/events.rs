// Each event below is emitted via `env.events().publish(topics, data)`.
// `data` is the `#[contracttype]` struct serialized as a Soroban `Map`, keyed
// by field name (not positional) — so `soroban-event-worker.ts`'s `decodeMap`
// reads fields by name and is order-independent. The one invariant the
// backend decoder DOES depend on is the **field name and scalar type** of
// every field listed here; renaming or retyping a field without updating the
// matching `decode*`/`handle*` pair in `soroban-event-worker.ts` will silently
// break event processing. See `backend/tests/events-wire-format.test.ts` for
// the pinned field/type table and `test_*_emits_event` tests in `test.rs` for
// the raw topic/data capture.
