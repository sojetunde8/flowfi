# Interactive Soroban RPC playground

Run real `get_stream`, `get_claimable_amount` and `withdraw` simulations
against **Stellar Testnet** without deploying anything. Responses include the
decoded Soroban XDR alongside the JSON value.

import Playground from '/src/components/SorobanPlayground';

<Playground defaultContractId="CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC" />

## How it works

- The playground issues **read calls** (`get_stream`,
  `get_claimable_amount`, `get_vesting_schedule`) and **simulation-only
  invocations** (`DryRun`) through a browser-side Soroban RPC client pointed
  at `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`.
- Mutating calls (create/withdraw) require a real signer; the console
  prepares the transaction and shows the XDR for signing in **Freighter**, so
  no keys ever touch the page.
- Pre-filled mock parameters are editable; the decoded result pane shows
  scalps, `ScVal` JSON, and raw base64 XDR side by side.

:::caution Testnet only
The default endpoint is Testnet. Pointing the playground at Mainnet is
possible but every call still goes through your own wallet for signing.
